# Pokemon-Card
A page that allows a user to look-up a pokemon by name or Id
Create a web page that will render a pokemon off
the free Pokemon api (pokeapi.com). It should show name,
image, and number (id) to the user, and you should be able
to search by name or by number. Searching for a new Pokemon
should update the data, not append new data to the page.
