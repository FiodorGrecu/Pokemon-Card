# Pokemon-Card
A page that allows a user to look-up a pokemon by name or Id
Create a web page that will render a pokemon off
the free Pokemon api (pokeapi.com). It should show name,
image, and number (id)from 1 to 898 and see the front picture
to the user, and you should be able
to search by name or by number. Searching for a new Pokemon
should update the data, not append new data to the page.

Enjoy the app.

Next for the app is to add button function on-click
to allow the scrol of cards without pressing the 
button Go Pokemon.
